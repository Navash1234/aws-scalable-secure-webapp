# AWS Cost Optimization Plan for Scalable & Secure Web Application

## 1. Compute Optimization (EC2)
- Right-Sizing Instances:
  - Analyze CPU, memory, and network usage to select appropriate EC2 instance types.  
  - Avoid over-provisioning to reduce unnecessary costs.
- Reserved Instances (RI):  
  - Purchase 1-year or 3-year RIs for predictable workloads to save up to 75% vs On-Demand pricing.
- Spot Instances:
  - Use for non-critical, flexible workloads to reduce cost by up to 90%.
- Auto Scaling:  
  - Automatically scale EC2 instances based on demand to minimize idle resources.

## 2. Storage Optimization (S3)
- S3 Lifecycle Policies:  
  - Move infrequently accessed data to S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access).  
  - Archive older data to S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive for long-term cost savings.
- Delete Unnecessary Objects:  
  - Enable object expiration policies for temporary files.
- S3 Storage Classes:  
  - Use appropriate storage class based on access frequency (Standard, IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier).

## 3. Database Optimization (RDS)
- Right-Sizing:
  - Choose the instance class that matches workload requirements. Avoid oversized instances.
- Multi-AZ only if Required:  
  - Use Multi-AZ for critical production databases. For dev/test, consider single-AZ to save cost.
- Reserved DB Instances:  
  - Purchase reserved RDS instances for steady-state workloads to save costs.
- Automated Backups:  
  - Retain only necessary backups and snapshots to reduce storage costs.

## 4. Monitoring & Alerts
- CloudWatch Metrics:  
  - Monitor usage of EC2, S3, and RDS to identify idle or underutilized resources.
- Cost Anomaly Detection:  
  - Set alerts for unusual cost spikes to take corrective action quickly.

## 5. General Best Practices
- Tagging Resources: 
  - Tag all AWS resources (EC2, S3, RDS) for proper cost tracking and accountability.
- Delete Unused Resources:  
  - Remove unused EC2 instances, EBS volumes, snapshots, and S3 buckets.
- Use AWS Trusted Advisor:  
  - Follow AWS recommendations for cost optimization, security, and performance.
